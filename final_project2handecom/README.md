For users who do not have an account, go to Sign in to register first.
You can log in normally to get access to users who already have an account.

Following registration, the following usage pages are presented for the Main page: 
1. The home screen allows you to scroll up and down and slide the splash screen.
2. Category: You can view product details by clicking on a specific category.
3. Cart: Displays the total number of things ordered.
4. Profile: Displays user information and allows you to log out normally.

Note: You cannot search in the tab bar and you cannot add products.
- The response and storage in the Backend portion include Login, Logout, and Signin.
- The final component is the frontend, which can respond in the form of UI.
